"&emsp;Text extraction from images is a common task in computer vision and"
" document processing. Tesseract OCR, a powerful open-source OCR engine, "
"provides the foundation for this script. Additionally, image "
"preprocessing steps are incorporated to improve the quality of text "
"recognition."

"<span class=\"bold\">2.1 Grayscale Conversion:</span><br>&emsp;The script"
" begins by converting the input image to grayscale using Opencv cvtColor "

"<span class=\"bold\">2.2 Skew Correction:</span><br>&emsp;Skewness in "
"images can negatively impact OCR accuracy. The getSkewAngle function "
"detects the skew angle and rotate Image corrects it. The process involves"
" thresholding, contour detection, and finding the minimum area rectangle "
"to determine the angle. "

"<span class=\"bold\">2.3 Noise Removal:</span><br><br>&emsp;Noise in "
"images can interfere with OCR. The noise_removal function employs "
"morphological operations to reduce noise, enhancing the clarity of the "
"text."

#: templates/docs.html:74
msgid ""
"&emsp;This script offers a comprehensive solution for text extraction "
"from images. By integrating Tesseract OCR with image preprocessing "
"techniques, it addresses common challenges associated with OCR, making it"
" suitable for a variety of applications, including document digitization "
"and text recognition in images. Users can easily adapt the script for "
"their specific needs, adjusting parameters or combining it with "
"additional image processing methods."
